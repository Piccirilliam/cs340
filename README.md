When writing programs, it's essential to focus on making them maintainable, readable, and adaptable. In the CRUD Python module I worked on, I ensured the code was modular, which allowed me to easily reuse and modify it for different parts of the project, such as connecting dashboard widgets to a database. This approach saves time, improves code quality, and simplifies debugging.

As a computer scientist approaching a project, I start by fully understanding the requirements, then design a solution, implement it, and continuously test and refine it based on feedback. For the project with Grazioso Salvare, I had to integrate multiple technologies, which differed from more straightforward tasks in other courses. In future projects, I plan to use data normalization, indexing, and constraints to enhance database efficiency and integrity.

Computer scientists play a critical role in solving complex problems and optimizing processes through technology. In practical terms, my project work helped Grazioso Salvare manage their animal data more efficiently, aiding their mission in animal rescue operations. The skills and strategies I've developed and applied here are not only beneficial for this project but are also invaluable for my future career in tech.
